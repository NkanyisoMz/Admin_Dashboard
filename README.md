# Admin Dashboard  

Welcome to my Admin Dashboard project! This is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, where I explore and practice CSS Grid to create a visually appealing and functional layout.  

## About the Project  

This dashboard demonstrates my understanding of CSS Grid by implementing a clean and organized layout suitable for an admin interface. It was designed with static styling in mind, as responsiveness was not a requirement for this project.  

## Features  

- **CSS Grid Layout**: The entire page is structured using CSS Grid to define the layout and organize components.  
- **Static Styling**: The project focuses on the desktop version of the design. Responsiveness has been deferred for now.  
- **Linked Stylesheet**: The styles are in an external CSS file, neatly organized for easy updates and maintenance.  

## Running the Project  

To view the project locally:  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.  

No additional setup is required.  

## Lessons Learned  

Through this project, I practiced:  
- Using CSS Grid to create complex layouts.  
- Structuring an admin interface with sections like header, content, and sidebars(navigation).  
- Enhancing my understanding of layout concepts without focusing on responsiveness.  

## Future Improvements  

While this project meets the current requirements, I plan to revisit it in the future to:  
1. Add responsiveness for different screen sizes.  
2. Enhance styling with animations and hover effects.
